# NiceCream - Old Town, Alexandria

A good local Ice Cream Chain nestled in Old Town Alexandria. It the heart of old town you can fin this ice cream shop. With all of the key ingredients being ice and liquid nitrogen it's arguably the freshest ice cream you can find in Old Town.

Simple flavors with nothing overly complex with a few seasonal flavors andif your not in the mood for ice cream there is always cookies and brownies made in the store. One of the things I like about this local chain is that you can watch everything made in the store.everything you can buy in the store is hand made by someone working in the store that day.

From the Ice Cream to the cookies it's one of the special touches on the this place that gives it good charm and honestly is what will keep me coming back.



### Atmosphere - 5/5
I like the feel Nice Cream for the most part. It's easier to get to by metro and even for old town there is even a small lot for parking if you happen to be driving by.  The Staff, super friendly and happy to get you anything you made need. Overall vibe is really nice one of the best Family Friendly spots in alexandria.

### Food 4.5/5
For the actual food what do you want me to say. This stuff is pretty top notch to be honest. In my opinion this beats out baskin Robbins any day.
The fact you can mix and match whatever you want is a plus too. People who aren't really picky about the quality of there ice cream won't really be able to tell the difference but I most definately think this is worth it.

### Price 3.5/5
Everything is decently priced for what you are buying. A bit higher priced than the pints you can buy in the supermarkets or at convenience stores. While priced very high I think most people wouldn't mind paying a premium for the quality. 10 dollars for a pint is still kind of high.

### King's Verdict

The King's verdict's a 4/5 for NiceCream. If you are in the area definitely give this place a try. A perfect family spot especially on a hot summer day or if you are just craving some realy good Ice Cream.

Feast on, my friends.
